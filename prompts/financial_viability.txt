Startup Idea:
{startup_idea}

Market Analysis:
{market_analysis}

Competition Analysis:

Risk Assessment:
{risk_assessment}

========== YOUR TASK ==========

Extract or estimate the following financial metrics:

1. REVENUE PROJECTIONS (in thousands $)
   - Year 1 projected revenue
   - Year 2 projected revenue
   - Year 3 projected revenue
   - If not explicitly stated, estimate based on:
     * Business model (SaaS, marketplace, e-commerce, etc.)
     * Market size from analysis
     * Comparable startup benchmarks

2. BURN RATE (monthly cash outflow in thousands $)
   - Average monthly operating expenses
   - Consider: salaries, infrastructure, marketing, operations
   - Estimate range: $10K-$500K based on startup stage

3. FUNDING NEEDED (total capital required in thousands $)
   - Amount needed to reach profitability or next milestone
   - Typical ranges:
     * Pre-seed: $50K-$500K
     * Seed: $500K-$2M
     * Series A: $2M-$15M

4. BREAKEVEN TIMELINE
   - Expected month to achieve positive cash flow (1-60 months)
   - Consider: revenue growth, burn rate, unit economics

5. GROSS MARGIN (percentage, 0-100%)
   - (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue
   - Typical ranges:
     * SaaS: 70-90%
     * Marketplace: 20-40%
     * E-commerce: 30-50%
     * Hardware: 30-60%

6. CASH RUNWAY (months)
   - How long current/raised capital lasts
   - Formula: Total Capital / Monthly Burn Rate
   - Calculate based on funding needed and burn rate

7. VIABILITY SCORE (0-100)
   - Overall financial health assessment
   - Consider: revenue growth, margins, capital efficiency, risk factors
   - >80: Excellent | 60-80: Good | 40-60: Moderate | <40: Concerning

8. COST STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
   - Breakdown of fixed vs variable costs
   - Identify major cost drivers
   - Assess cost efficiency

9. REVENUE MODEL
   - How the startup generates revenue
   - Pricing strategy and unit economics
   - Scalability assessment

========== EXAMPLE ==========

Input: "SaaS platform targeting SMBs, $50/user/month, aiming for 1000 users Y1, 5000 Y2, 20000 Y3. Need $500K seed funding. Team of 5."

Output:
{{
  "revenue_projections": [600, 3000, 12000],
  "burn_rate": 50,
  "funding_needed": 500,
  "breakeven_month": 18,
  "gross_margin": 85,
  "cash_runway": 10,
  "viability_score": 75,
  "cost_structure": "Fixed costs: Salaries (60%), Infrastructure (15%), Marketing (20%), Operations (5%). Variable costs are minimal for SaaS model.",
  "revenue_model": "Subscription-based SaaS with $50/user/month pricing. Annual contracts provide predictable revenue. Low CAC through PLG strategy. Strong unit economics with 85% gross margins."
}}

========== ESTIMATION GUIDELINES ==========

When numbers are NOT explicitly provided:

- Revenue Projections:
  * Start conservative (10-50 customers Y1 for B2B)
  * Apply 3-5x growth Y1→Y2, 2-4x growth Y2→Y3
  * Multiply by average revenue per customer

- Burn Rate:
  * Seed stage team (2-5 people): $30-80K/month
  * Early stage (5-15 people): $80-200K/month
  * Consider location (US vs other markets)

- Funding Needed:
  * Aim for 18-24 months runway
  * Formula: Burn Rate × 18-24 months

- Breakeven:
  * SaaS: 18-36 months typical
  * Marketplace: 24-48 months
  * E-commerce: 12-24 months

Be realistic and conservative. Investors value honesty over optimism.

Output ONLY valid JSON. No additional text or explanations.
